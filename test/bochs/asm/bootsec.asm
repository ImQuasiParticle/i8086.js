Beginning from C,$Assembly, C++ ending up with Ruby, Python and Javascript$ES8 I was creating bigger and bigger projects slowly$learning how to organise large scale apps.  About 6 years$ago surfing over the internet I discovered Github and$Sourceforge.net and started to upload my "quality content"$there. I stayed here to this day. All projects, all tasks$which I have done in my current company and in my personal$code are written as best as I can.$$### Skills(with level)$- Large Single Page App creation and maintaince(React /$Lerna monorepos)$- Coffee Script, TypeScript, Javascript ES8(with many T39$useful proposals implemented in Babel) - Advanced$- GraphQL / Subscriptions - Advanced$- **Functional Programming**(using Ramda, Ramda Fantasy,$RX.js) - Advanced$- CSS / JSS(css in js, mainly JSS)$- Socket.io$- Webpack / Gulp / Grunt / Rollup - bundlers$- Jade(Slim - Pug) / HTML5 / Canvas / WebGL(OpenGL 4+)$- Ruby On Rails(and integration old projects with newest$SSR React)$- Node.JS / Express(with Redis and advanced geolocation$integration)$- **React** (with SSR related stuff), JQuery, Lodash, Ramda$and many other JS NPM libs$- Adserver implementations(GPT, Adocean) / Analytics /$Google Tags / Ad creations implementations$- SEO Optimizations(dealing with SSR React stuff and making$bots happy to see all JS components)$- Monorepos repo organisation(Yarn workspaces, Lerna)$- Linux$$### Hobby projects$Ordered by coolness(in my opinion ofc):$- _Asynchronous SSR Blog Example_(with ES7 module to handle$async backend data in SSR side - in express.js for$example)$Technology: **React**, **ES8**, **Webpack**<br/>$Link:$https://github.com/Mati365/react-asynchronous-ssr-blog$Description:  React has a huge problem related to handle$SSR Asynchronous data. In many commercial project which I$have been working I learned one - SSR is pain, but content$loads faster. I managed to write a simple example for other$people to see how large scale apps in my projects handle$async promise data. Maybe it will help somebody? It uses$one trick: renders whole tree twice, first - generating$tree with promises, second - loading cached data. It is$much easier and more portable than _Redux_$implementation(because it uses _Context_). In bigger$project I realized that it can be used also with _Redis_$and _GraphQL_ which lead me to write GraphQL client(because$_Apollo_ is not suitable for big commercial apps due to mem$leaks).  $$- _neural-cars_ $Technology: **React**, **ES8**, **Webpack**, **Canvas**$Link: $https://github.com/Mati365/neural-cars $https://github.com/Mati365/kart-racing monorepo $Description:  Neural-Cars is a simple AI base for my new$project(_kart-racing_). It was a school project which$demonstrated using neural networks in wild. All collision$detection, neural network implementation and others stuff I$have written on my own. $$- _i8086.js_ $Technology: **React**, **ES6**, **Webpack** $Link: https://github.com/Mati365/i8086.js$Description:  i8086.js is a _really_ simple x86 virtual$machine written in plain JS(without any helpers libs). VM$supports some 32bit instructions from newer CPUs(intel$8286) and around 70%-80% 16bit instructions(intel 8086).$For now I can run on it "simple" operating systems like$_MikeOS_ which has thousands of opcodes and does not have$IVT support. My mistake was writing _BIOS_ not as$embeddable binary blob but as _ES6_ module because I needed$to write many interrupts and port handlers. Writting only$port handlers as external devices and using precompiled$_BIOS_ would be easier.   $$- _reddit-news_ $Technology: **Vue**, **CSS**, **ES6**, **Gulp** $Link: https://github.com/Mati365/reddit-news$Description:  Reddit client written in **Vue.JS** created$because Im lazy. I wanted to see reddit without opening$new tab in popup. Supports OAuth, notifications, switching$tags, multis etc.$$- _soccer-js_ $Technology: **HTML5**, **Canvas**, **Gulp**,$**Socket.io** $Link: https://github.com/Mati365/Soccer.js$Description:  Soccer.js was a open source Haxball clone. I$wanted to learn how to use socket.io to write real time,$multiplayer which enjoys me and my friends. I abandoned$project - designing UI in HTML5 Canvas is overkill(I wasted$60% time on it). $$- _ad-tester_ $Technology: **React**, **Chrome Extension API** $Link: https://github.com/Mati365/ad-tester $Description:  In my current company I created many Ads$creations that integrates directly with website. It was$really hard to debug frame ads so I have written in my free$home time tool to help my friends working in _Traffic_ to$see ads and debug them "live" on page. After clicking some$ads it allows user to replace its html and execute$slot. $$... any many others on https://github.com/Mati365$$### Commercial $- **01-04-2016** to **now** - Lead Frontend developer at$Adretail Grupa Interia.pl $Technologies: **React**, **Webpack**, **Rails**,$**GraphQL**, **Angular.js**, **GPT**, **Adocean** and many$many others $$I was working with 5 "big" e-paper websites:$- _Okazjum.pl_$- _Promocyjni.pl_$- _Promoceny.pl_$- _Adretail.pl_ $- _Anonymous_ lets say(large SPA react app as a lead$frontend developer) :) $$... and around ~10 internal "admin" pages(also written in$React). All admin pages(like E-Paper Leaflet editors) were$written in Rails/React in around 2 years. Many of them were$written directly as SPA apps but most of them were using$the same lets say "theme" monorepo package with 300-340+$Components, something like bootstrap). All front(and$express.js) related stuff in panels(and themes monorepo)$were written by me from scratch(without using any React$helpers modules etc. due to Rails integration issues).$Except all of them I was aslo an front lead developer$something like Twitter embeddable module(and admin panel to$handle it) which users paste on their pages. It was a$pretty big project because except iframes it should work as$NPM module and should be integrated directly to 10 years$old websites(without NPM) - it was so damn hard thing to do$but using prerendering feature of react and express / redis$- all worked correctly as reusable external-rendered$partial). Except that I was also responsible for supporting$all "big" pages with creating reusable leaflets browser$component(with JSS, and reusable themes with Adserver$integration), implementing Ads(with _SRA_ support and lazy$loading). But the hardest project "part" which I have done$were - **slider(with draggable container, seo friendly with$endless scrolling)**, **image zoom**. Due to react-slider$issues(mainly because it does not support SSR :( ) I had to$write custom infinity leaflet slider component from$scratch. I did exactly the same with image zoom component.$That components were not big - but really hard to$write(keeping SEO integration in mind). $$- **01-02-2016** to **01-04-2016** - Fullstack developer in$Quantitative Engineering Design$$Programming backend and frontend using ES6, JavaScript 1.7,$Python Django and Vue.JS.
